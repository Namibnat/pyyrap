# YRAP - Your Routines and Projects

# NOTE:

This project is just in early stage development, so expect both the code and this readme to change
significantly.

## What Is YRAP All About

This project is very personal, and so it's usage may not be useful to most people.  However,
you'd probably be able to adapt it to your use case provided you know a bit of Python.

The idea is to have an interface which provides a service to manage projects and routines
in one place.  The projects idea is based on the popular book ["Getting Things Done"][GTD] by
David Allan.
